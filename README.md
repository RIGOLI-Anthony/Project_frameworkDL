# Project_frameworkDL


This is a project aiming to recreate from scratch the functions of a framework to build and train simple DNN.

## The aim

- Being able to build simple model including simple classifier, CNN, RNN or even auto-encoder

- Train model by two means :

    - Writing our own training loop

    - Call for a function that has default setting to do it for us

- Data structure might remain simple numpy arrays for the inputs and weights

- Simple plot function of the model or ``callback`` function for loss ploting over training

## What is not included 

- GPU based calculus


## Might come later

- Include as a library

- Add GPU optimization

- Add some optimizer

- More loss function
